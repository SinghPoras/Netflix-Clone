This is a Clone Project which I made just to practice and enhance my skills of HTML and CSS.\n
In this project, I made a Netflix Website's Landing Page only for desktop mode(not responsive).\n
The Images folder contains all the image assets used in this project whereas the Vedios folder contains all the Vedios.\n
The index.html file contains the source code of HTML content which I wrote in this project and style.css file contains the source code of CSS content.\n
